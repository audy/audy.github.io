I really like bots. Here's a list of Twitter bots I've made:

- [@new_taxonomies](https://twitter.com/new_taxonomies) - tweets whenever there is an
  update to the NCBI taxonomy database
- [@gvillejunk](https://twitter.com/gvillejunk) - items posted to the
  Gainesville, FL Craigslist "free" section.
- [@hmmdarwin](https://twitter.com/hmmdarwin) - Markov bot trained on the major
  works of Charles Darwin.
- [@meowhector](https://twitter.com/meowhector) - Bot about my cat.
- [@cappstories](https://twitter.com/cappstories) - True stories from Capp
   St., SF. Made using [Cheap Bots Done Quick](http://cheapbotsdonequick.com/)
   and [Tracery](http://www.crystalcodepalace.com/traceryTut.html#).
- [@pizza_dolores](https://twitter.com/pizza_dolores) - in dedication to my
   favorite Dolores Park vendor.
- [@every_omics](https://twitter.com/every_omics) - Random 'Omicses


I also maintain a list of bots and add to it whenever I find a new one. As of
this writing, there are 3.9K bots:

If you want to make your own Twitter bot, I recommend
https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/ which lets you create one using a generative
grammar which sounds complicated but it's is really just writing a"choose your
own adventure" novel using JSON.
