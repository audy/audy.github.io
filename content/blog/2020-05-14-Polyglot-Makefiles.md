Did you know that you can change the shell in a `Makefile`? It's true. I found
this out when trying to use bash instead of the default `/bin/sh` by setting
`SHELL`.

```makefile
.ONESHELL:
bash: SHELL := bash
bash:
	# note: the double dollar-sign is required because Make substitues $variables
	export greeting="Â¡hola"
	echo "$${greeting}, bash!"
```

Now typing `make bash` will print `Â¡hola, bash!`


What else is possible? Can I use other programming languages as the shell?  Is
it possible to write in-line Python in a `Makefile`?

### Python

```makefile
.ONESHELL:
python: SHELL := python3
python:
	greeting = "hello"
	print(f"{greeting}, python!")
```

[Yes, this is possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtyjaSqdh2I)

Typing `make python` will print `hello, python!`.

Notice that there is a variable `.ONESHELL` being set. Normally, `make` will
evaluate each command in a separate shell meaning that, in this example,
`greeting` would be undefined in the second line. Adding `.ONESHELL` to the top
of your `Makefile`, as recommended by [someone else whose last name begins with
Davis-\* and blogs about `make`](https://tech.davis-hansson.com/p/make/),
causes multi-line code in the Make directive to be evaluated in a single call
to Python.

### R

What about writing R in-line in a Makefile? Note the addition of `.SHELLFLAGS`.
By default, `make` runs `SHELL -c "your\nscript\nhere"` which is not compatible
R. To run a script in-line from a command in R, you use `-e`:

```makefile
R: .SHELLFLAGS := -e
R: SHELL := Rscript
R:
	greeting = "bonjour"
	message(paste0(greeting, ", R!"))
```

This is equivalent to running `Rscript -e 'greeting = "bounjour"; message(paste0(greeting, ", R!"));'`

Now you can write a pipeline that combines R and Python in a single file ðŸŽ‰

### Bring in the containers

Data analysis pipelines often have
[adventurous](https://github.com/thackl/gggenomes#motivation--concept)
dependencies. Docker made all of that a lot easier but writing `docker run ...`
can be cumbersome. What if we could make Docker the interpreter and write
commands to be executed inside the container in-line as well?

```makefile
docker: .SHELLFLAGS = run --volume $(shell pwd):/workdir --rm --workdir /workdir --entrypoint /bin/bash ubuntu -c
docker: SHELL := docker
docker:
	echo "hello, $$(uname -a)!"
```

Again, this is possible. Running `make docker` will run `echo ...` in a Docker
container running Ubuntu. Note the `--volume` flag which will mount the current
working directory as the container's working directory meaning that files can
be read/created between your local filesystem and that of the container. So
build artifacts can be shared between make directives.

```
### Why?

This started as an experiment to see what is possible with `make`. But it was
motivated by a real world problem: I often need to combine tools across
programming languages and environments to run data analysis pipelines. I like
to automate things and `make` is a great tool for doing so. Having everything
in-line is more readable and having everything in a single file means that I
have to jump between fewer tabs to understand the pipeline itself.

The ability to write commands that get executed in Docker means that I have to
spend less time figuring out how to get a bunch of dependencies installed in a
single container which becomes increasingly difficult as the number of
dependencies increases (especially if you work in Bioinformatics).

### Complete Example

**note**: Some of these features only work on `make 4.+` which I installed
using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). These examples do not work using `make 3.x`
which is comes with macOS Catalina.

```makefile
.ONESHELL:
.SILENT:

main: \
	python \
	ruby \
	R \
	bash \
	docker

docker: .SHELLFLAGS = run --rm --entrypoint /bin/bash ubuntu -c
docker: SHELL := docker
docker:
	echo "hello, $$(uname -a)!"

python: SHELL := python3
python:
	greeting = "hello"
	print(f"{greeting}, python!")

ruby: .SHELLFLAGS := -e
ruby: SHELL := ruby
ruby:
	greeting = "labas"
	puts "#{greeting}, ruby!"

R: .SHELLFLAGS := -e
R: SHELL := Rscript
R:
	greeting = "bonjour"
	message(paste0(greeting, ", R!"))

bash: .SHELLFLAGS := -euo pipefail -c
bash: SHELL := bash
bash:
	export greeting="Â¡hola"
	echo "$${greeting}, bash!"
```
