I haven't written a blog post since I made a blog so I decided that I'm going to always write a blog post on Friday even if I have nothing to write about.

This week: an awesome script.

This little snippet of ruby (combined with the S3 gem) will print a random number to a file, upload the file to S3, and return the URL.

{% highlight ruby %}
KEY = 'KEY'
SECRET = 'SECRET'

require 'aws/s3'

AWS::S3::Base.establish_connection!(
  :access_key_id => KEY,
  :secret_access_key => SECRET
)


class Bucket < AWS::S3::S3Object
  set_current_bucket_to 'test'
end

n = rand(5)
$stderr.puts n
Bucket.store('sample.txt', n.to_s)

puts Bucket.find('sample.txt').url
{% endhighlight %}

Invoke thusly,

{% highlight bash %}
$ curl `ruby s3.rb`
5
5
{% endhighlight %}

Isn't that just awesome?

See you next Friday.
